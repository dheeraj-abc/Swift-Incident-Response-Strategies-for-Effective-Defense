I've implemented a **Python-based incident response simulation** that detects, triages, contains, eradicates, and recovers from a cybersecurity threat. Running this script will simulate real-time incident handling.

Next steps :

- Run the script and capture output logs.
- Analyze the effectiveness of this simulated response.
- Enhance with real-world cybersecurity tools (e.g., SIEM integration).
