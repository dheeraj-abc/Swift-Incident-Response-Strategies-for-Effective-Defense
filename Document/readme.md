**Swift Incident Response: Strategies for Effective Defense**

**Introduction**
Swift Incident Response: Strategies for Effective Defense" is a cybersecurity project that simulates
an effective incident response mechanism. This document outlines the implementation of an
automated threat detection and mitigation system. The primary objective is to provide a structured
approach to identifying, analyzing, containing, and resolving cybersecurity threats.

**Objectives**
- Implement an automated cybersecurity incident response framework.
- Detect and classify threats in real-time.
- Execute triage, containment, eradication, and recovery steps efficiently.
- Simulate an automated workflow for incident handling.
  
**Features & Functionalities**
- Threat Detection: Identifies various cyber threats, including malware, phishing, DDoS, and
ransomware.
- Incident Triage: Assigns severity levels to detected threats.
- Threat Containment: Takes necessary actions to prevent threat propagation.
- Threat Eradication: Removes the detected threat from the system.
- System Recovery: Restores normal operations post-incident.
  
**Implementation Details**
The project is implemented using Python, with functions dedicated to each step of the incident
response process. The simulation involves detecting a threat, triage, containment, eradication,
recovery, and confirming the process execution.

**Code Structure**
- detect_threat(): Simulates threat detection.
- triage_incident(threat): Determines severity levels.
- contain_threat(threat): Prevents further damage.
- eradicate_threat(threat): Removes the malicious entity.
- recover_system(): Ensures full system recovery.
- incident_response_pipeline(): Orchestrates the entire workflow.
  
**Execution Process**
To run the incident response simulation, execute the script:
python incident_response.py
Upon execution, the system will detect a random cyber threat, analyze and classify the severity,
apply containment strategies, eradicate the detected threat, restore normal system functionality, and
conclude the response process with a success message.

**Future Enhancements**
- Integration with SIEM tools for real-time monitoring.
- Automated alerting systems to notify security teams.
- Machine learning integration to predict and prevent attacks.
  
**Conclusion**
This project serves as a foundational model for an automated incident response system,
demonstrating essential cybersecurity measures for detecting and mitigating threats efficiently. By
implementing such a system, organizations can enhance their resilience against evolving cyber
threats.
